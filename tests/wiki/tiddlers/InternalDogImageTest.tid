It should be possible to embed an image that's a tiddler within the wiki into a question, and to sync the image into Anki's media folder.

When exporting the image to static, TiddlyWiki embeds the image as a data: URI, which Python's URL library is fully capable of extracting and writing to a file. This means we don't have to explicitly include the image in a filter and then match it up to the `src` attribute or anything funky like that, it Just Worksâ„¢.
