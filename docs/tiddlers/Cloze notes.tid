//Cloze deletion// is a technique for creating flashcards
where you delete or hide (//occlude//, in fancy memory terms)
a part of a sentence and try to fill in the blank.
It's often faster and easier to create cloze notes than [[Question-and-answer notes]].

Cloze notes are created with the `remembercz` macro, putting the part you want to occlude in single braces, like this:

```
<<remembercz "20200523164451023"
    "You create a cloze note in TiddlyRemember using the {remembercz} macro."
>>
```

<<remembercz "20200523164451023"
    "You create a cloze note in TiddlyRemember using the {remembercz} macro."
>>

(When you flip the card, the `[...]` is filled in with the answer.)

Clicking the black (right-hand) lightbulb icon on the editor toolbar will insert a `remembercz` snippet.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut (Alt+Shift+R by default, customizable in the keyboard shortcuts panel).
